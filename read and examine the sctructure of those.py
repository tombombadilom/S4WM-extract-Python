tu dois d'abord extraire les questions une par une avec le patern X. ou XX. ou XXX. attention le pattern peut etre collé à la question precedente.

2. ensuite tu dois identifier le pattern de fin de question et extraire le nombre de reponse possible 
2.1 pattern : Thereare 2 correct answers || There are 2 correct answers || There are 2correct answers || Thereare 2 correctanswers 
extraie le nombre de reponse (int) du pattern et place le dans la variable question_number.

3. utilise ce pattern pour extraire les choix de réponse qui se trouvent apres ce pattern 

4. traite les choix de réponse 
 {
        "number": 43,
        "text": "", // raw question text
        "label": "",// text sans le numero , le pattern du nombre de reponse e les choix de reponse
        "choices": [
            {
                id: 1,
                name: "A",
                "label": "reponse A"
            },
            ....
        ], 
        "question_number": null,
        "type": "radio",
        "valid": false
    },


then deduct the format of the array of json object that can be extracted from each page 
and elaborate a method that will step by step valide the regex pattern 
- question_pattern
- option_pattern
- correct_answers_pattern

that you are going to elaborate for that code:

def identify_patterns(text):

    # Define a regex pattern to capture the question structure
    pattern = r'(\d+\..*?)(?=<br />)(<br />.*?)([A-E].*?)(?=(\d+\.|$))'

    matches = re.finditer(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    for match in matches:
        question_number_and_text = match.group(1).strip()
        answer_section = match.group(3).strip()

        # Break down answer section further if needed
        answers = re.findall(r'([A-E])([^A-E]+)', answer_section)
        
        # Output results
        print(f"{question_number_and_text}")
        for answer in answers:
            print(f"{answer[0]}: {answer[1].strip()}")
    question_pattern = re.compile(r'\d+\.(.*?)<br />')
    option_pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z])\s*(.*?)<br />')
    correct_answers_pattern = re.compile(r'There are (\d+) correct answers')
    
    question_chunks = question_pattern.split(text)
    identified_data = []
    
    for i in range(1, len(question_chunks), 3):
        try:
            question_number = int(question_chunks[i].strip())
            question_text = question_chunks[i + 1].strip()
            options = [{'label': m.group(1), 'text': m.group(2).strip()} for m in option_pattern.finditer(question_text)]
            correct_answers_match = correct_answers_pattern.search(question_text)
            correct_answers_count = correct_answers_match.group(1) if correct_answers_match else "unknown"
            
            question_data = {
                "number": question_number,
                "text": question_text.split('<br />')[0],
                "options": options,
                "correct_answers_count": correct_answers_count
            }
            identified_data.append(question_data)
            
            # Logging successful parsing
            logging.info(f"Successfully parsed question number: {question_number}")
        except ValueError as e:
            logging.error(f"ValueError encountered: {e} - Data: {question_chunks[i]}")
            continue
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Unexpected error: {e} - Data: {question_chunks[i]}")
            continue
    
    return identified_data
